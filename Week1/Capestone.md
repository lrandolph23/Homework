# Lacy Randolph Capstone Project 2023
- ### Definition Statement
  - I want to build an application that can track meteorites and space weather for the interest of alien travelers and cosmonauts. Eventually I would like to add accounts for the “Experiences” map.
- ### Definition of Audience
  - People who are curious about the conditions outside earth’s atmosphere.
- ### Intro and Elevator Speech:
  - I want to build this application so people who experience the unexplained have a safe place to share their experiences. For the cosomonauts I want to create a weather website where they can track flying conditions for star travel. The weather is also good to see patterns in experiences and watch for correlations.
- ### Outline of content
  - What do I want on each page? (text / pics / images / navigation)
    - **Home**: Welcome message, alien home button, pages menu
    - **Weather**: Space travel message, space weather API, meteorite API, search
    - **About**: Fun stuff about me, mission statement, and link to linkedin
    - **Contact**: Links to website social media and a picture of a group of aliens
    - **Map**: Experiences heat map, alien pictures, search
  - What do I want the functionality of each page to be?
    - **Home**: pages navigation, some kind of messages based on the weather conditions?
    - **Weather**: search for location on weather map
    - **About**: a little bit about me(or not me)

- ### Research
  - [Arcgis](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=6cd609921ebc44ff914a4e8059813b16)
    - I like the simplicity of the heat map. It’s very straightforward.
    - I don’t like how it’s pre existing experiences and not new or personal.
    - I want my application to be just as user friendly but to be more personal for the user.
  - [YouMap](https://youmap.com/app/2-ufo-reporting/posts)
    - I like how users are able to submit experience locations and how user friendly
    - I don’t like that you can’t read about the experiences, you can just see where it happened.
    - I want my website to let people tell their story and to show them space weather.
  - [History](https://www.history.com/ufo-sightings-location-map)
    - I like how this is government recognized abductions.
    - I don’t like how users can only view the locations but not read the stories.
    - I want my application to be very informative to the user and personal.
- ### Create wireframes and user flow diagram for at least 4 pages including Home, About, Contact Us and one other page demonstrating the specific functionality of your capstone's purpose (add link to wireframes one wireframe for each page with a min of 4 pages):
